# Terraform Code Samples

## Overview
This repository contains Terraform code, bash scripts, and PowerShell scripts that I've put together and use for experimentation. Feel free to use samples from this repository within the scope of the rules listed below.

## The rules
* This code is licensed under the [MIT license](LICENSE). You can certainly open issues with questions and I'll do my best to answer them when time permits. However, it's on you to determine why it doesn't work for you. Don't waste your time or my time opening issues that only say "The code doesn't work." 
* You can submit pull requests for improvements and I'll incorporate them if they make sense. Note this is coded for my chaotic brain and not yours so sometimes the way I code things will not align with your practices. That's ok!
* Sometimes I may break the base labs or modules. I'll fix them when time allows. This could be days and sometimes may be weeks.
* Any executable scripts you see included are typically written for zsh or bash shell. If you're running them on Windows, you'll likely need to make changes to them.
* If you find code from here useful let me know! It's always wonderful to get feedback from peers in the field.
* If you incorporate this code into something you develop do me a favor and link the repository in your code or documentation.
